# Interpreted, Optimized, JITed and Compiled Brainfuck implementations

This repo contains a series of [brainfuck] implementations based on [Eli
Bendersky blog post series about Brainfuck and JIT compilation][eli], but
rewritten in Rust.

These implementations were developed as I was writing my [Compiling Brainfuck
Series][my_series].
